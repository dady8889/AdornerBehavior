# AdornerBehavior
Adorner Behavior by wuijong and Ashley Davis.
This is a fixed version viable for use in modern world.

## Changes
* MultiChildAdornerBehavior.AdornerChildren does not need an encapsulating array.
* Built against .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Core 3.1.
* The codebase was refactored and cleaned.

## Usage
Check out the TestApp Project or the original [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/123638/A-Resusable-Attached-Behavior-for-Defining-Adorner).

## Disclaimer
The code **was not tested** thorougly, and probably **is not** suitable for use in production.
I am open to suggestions and PRs.

## Licenses
Original work was licensed under CPOL and so is this.
